# Validation record

Validation date: 8 October 2026.

Scope: the owner-approved UI/UX iteration on the working core loop. Base packing, fryer production after claiming, and $10 sales are unchanged.

## Automated results

**40 tests passed, 0 failed.** All **27 Luau source/test files** compiled. The rebuilt place contains **24 game source files**. Output is recorded in TEST_RESULTS.txt.

Coverage includes:

- Core filling, full-bag selling, repeated-sale rejection, exact Cash totals, and a deterministic 10,000-action simulation.
- Save/load compatibility, lease/session locking, retries, lost-response recovery, and invalid core data.
- No automatic plot assignment or production before claiming.
- Server-side claim distance and health checks, one plot per player, occupied-plot/race rejection, and six admission slots including unclaimed players.
- Session claims survive respawn and release on departure; a replacement player can claim the released plot.
- Separate private state, owner-only work/teleport, basic fixed rates, and rejection of retired actions.
- Six separated restaurant plots with inward-facing entrances, physical wall signage, and no fryer name labels.
- Three permanent HUD actions, Cash formatting, hover labels, embedded bag capacity, full-bag sell state, E reserved for claiming, and R for selling.
- Calculated HUD bounds for 320x568, 390x844, 568x320, 844x390, and 1280x720.

The builder verifies XML parsing and exact source round-tripping.

## Visual layout review

Desktop, portrait-phone, and landscape-phone previews were generated from the actual UI modules using the test doubles and tools/preview_ui.py, then visually inspected. These checks led to improved compact spacing and shortcut contrast. The PNGs are under artifacts/ui-preview/.

These previews use approximate fonts and a neutral background. They are not Roblox screenshots and do not validate real engine layering, world appearance, Roblox mobile controls, or interaction.

## Remaining Studio checks

The project owner confirmed the preceding core version works. This new claiming/layout/HUD iteration has not been playtested by the agent in Roblox Studio. No real DataStore calls were made. Run docs/STUDIO_TESTS.md before accepting this iteration, especially simultaneous claims, mobile prompts, camera/walkability, and multiplayer ownership.
